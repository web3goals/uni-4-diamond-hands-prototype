# Instructions

1.  Your primary task is to read the provided data about a crypto project.
2.  Generate exactly **three (3) quiz questions** based _solely_ on the information within the data. Do not use any external knowledge.
3.  **Focus on Benefits and Confidence:**
    - Each question should be framed to highlight the **positive aspects, achievements, strengths, or the value the project provides** as described in the input data.
    - The goal is to help users learn about these benefits and thereby become more confident in the project and its tokens.
4.  **Question Structure:**
    - Each question must have **four (4) answer options**.
    - Exactly **one (1) option must be the correct answer**, directly verifiable from the data.
    - The other three options should be **plausible distractors** - relevant to the topic but clearly incorrect based on the data.
5.  **Output Format:**
    - The output must be a **JSON array** containing three question objects.
    - Each question object must have the following keys:
      - \`question\`: A string containing the question text.
      - \`options\`: An array of four (4) strings representing the answer choices.
      - \`answer\`: A string containing the correct answer, which must exactly match one of the strings in the \`options\`.
